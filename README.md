<h1 align="center" id="title">Driving and Vehicle License Department (DVLD)</h1>



<h2>üöÄ Overview</h2>


The Driving & Vehicle License Department (DVLD) is a robust C# Windows Forms desktop application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and ADO.NET for data access and management.
This system is designed to streamline, modernize, and automate the processes related to the issuance, renewal, detention, and management of both driver and vehicle licenses.

By integrating comprehensive validation, a multi-layered architecture, and adherence to national and international licensing standards, DVLD provides a secure, reliable, and user-friendly experience for managing all licensing operations efficiently.
